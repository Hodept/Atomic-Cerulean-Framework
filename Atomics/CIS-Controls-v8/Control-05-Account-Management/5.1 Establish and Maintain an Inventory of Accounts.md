## Atomic Test #1 - Splunk LDAPSearch

### Description

You can configure Splunk to watch for changes to your LDAP directory and collect user and machine metadata. You can use this feature combined with dynamic list lookups to decorate or modify events with any information available in LDAP. See [About lookups](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Knowledge/Aboutlookupsandfieldactions) in the *Knowledge Manager Manual*.

After you configure Splunk Enterprise to monitor LDAP, it takes a baseline snapshot of the AD schema. It uses this snapshot to establish a starting point for monitoring.

[The ldapsearch command - Splunk Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SA-LdapSearch/3.0.3/User/Theldapsearchcommand)

#### **Supported Platforms:** Linux

#### Evidence Commands: Run with SPL [(**Splunk's Search Processing Language**)]((https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/search-processing-language.html))

```SPL
| rest /services/data/indexes 
| where disabled = 0 
| search NOT title = "_*" 
| eval currentDBSizeGB = round( currentDBSizeMB / 1024) 
| where currentDBSizeGB > 0 
| table splunk_server title summaryHomePath_expanded minTime maxTime currentDBSizeGB totalEventCount frozenTimePeriodInSecs coldToFrozenDir maxTotalDataSizeMB 
| rename minTime AS earliest maxTime AS latest summaryHomePath_expanded AS index_path currentDBSizeGB AS index_size totalEventCount AS event_cnt frozenTimePeriodInSecs AS index_retention coldToFrozenDir AS index_path_frozen maxTotalDataSizeMB AS index_size_max title AS index
```

# Mappings to applicable control families:

### **CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v4 Groups**

### DSP-16

Data Retention and Deletion - Data retention, archiving and deletion is managed in accordance with business requirements, applicable laws and regulations.

### **CMMC Groups**

### AM.3.036

Define procedures for the handling of CUI data.

### **MITRE Enterprise ATT&CK v8.2 Groups**

### T1070

Indicator Removal on Host - Adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware. Locations and format of logs are platform or product-specific, however standard operating system logs are captured as Windows events or Linux/macOS files such as Bash History and /var/log/*.

### T1070.001

Clear Windows Event Logs - Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.

### T1070.002

Clear Linux or Mac System Logs - Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs. The majority of native system logging is stored under the /var/log/ directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions.
