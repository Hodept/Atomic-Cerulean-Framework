# Frequently Asked Questions:   Atomic Cerulean Framework.

## What is Atomic Cerulean?

Atomic Cerulean was created as a part of research for the SANS Masters degree program.   All content was created as a means to solve or imporve institutional gaps in auditing and compliance.   All content can be found at the following url - [Richard Horne](https://sites.google.com/view/cerulean-framework-rhorne/home) 

## Is Atomic Cerulean free to use?

Yes,   Atomic Cerulean is an open-source tool that is free to use and build off of.  Come share and build with us. 

## How do I use Cerulean?

Use should be intuitive, at least that is how it was designed.   Start at the top of each attomic and dive in.  The follow of each atomic should guide you from defining control logic to knowing how to correlate and cross reference other controls. 

## What do you guarantee?

Nothing is guaranteed with this framework. Code might not work, ideas might be wrong. This framework is not going to make your audit a sure fire win. Wish we could, but we purpose ideas for you to build off of. Full Stop.  Nothing more.  If you want to help us improve our ideas lend a hand. 

## How do I read the Atomics?

Atomics are built off of the Frameworks Six core points.  Work through each of these and you will be as informed as any of us.

Linking saves time when multiple audits are taken on by an<br> organization as similar, or the same evidence can be re-used. |

## Which Atomic do I choose?

Choosing an atomic can be as easy as:

1. Find your audit (PCI, HIPPA, FedRamp, NIST 800 53 etc.)

2. Find your Control (Example "AU-4")

3. Find your Sub-Control ("AU-4.1")

4. Find the Atomic that best suits your organizations technology stack (Splunk, ELK, Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Active Directory etc.)

5. Double check the SCF SP-CMM leveling guide to match your organizational maturity 

6. Take some code, leave some code

7. Come back often

## There is no Atomic for the technology that I use. What can be done?

Atomic Cerulean is still young and not able to account for all technology stacks. If you would like to help us, use our template to build and submit new atomics. 

## This Atomic is incorrect; what should I do?

Seucrity is a group effort sometimes.  We try hard to make sure that our content is correct, but sometimes we suck.  "rm -rf *"  is not an option.  So roll up your sleves and help a fellow out.
