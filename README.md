Please note: all files are provided to assist security professionals in understanding the behavior and interactions between an organization and an audit.  They are examples intended to invoke thought and should not be used as baseline configurations in any situation. Remember to always read the manual whenever working with important configurations and importantly read all audit requirements.  This should only be leveraged as a means of elevating an organizations audit evidence and NOT to be the baseline.  

Thank you for all your support.
